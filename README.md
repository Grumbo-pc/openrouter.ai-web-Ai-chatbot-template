# openrouter.ai-web-Ai-chatbot-template
An AI chatbot template for openrouter.ai that runs completely on HTML and Javascript and embedded complexly in one HTML file so it is great for hosting on static website hosts such as github pages
<br>
(youtube video of how to setup coming soon)
<br>
Open the HTML file in your IDE of choice I use VS code <br>
Optional: change the styling to your liking <br>
Change the names and branding <br>
Go to https://openrouter.ai/ and sign up and get an API Key <br>
Optional: browse https://openrouter.ai/models for other AI models <br>
In the Javascript tag area replace the value of "const API_KEY" to your actual API key (WARNING: it is NOT advised to keep your API keys this is an example/template file) <br>
Replace the value of "const systemPrompt" with any instructions you want your chatbot to act as such as behaviour or the topic to talk about or facts it does not know <br>
Open the index.html file in your browser of choice and test if your chatbot works <br>
If it does not work ive added some console logging from the original version for debugging and diagnostics you access the console from opening DevTools then going to the console tab
